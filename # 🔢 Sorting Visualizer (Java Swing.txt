## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Visualizes 5 Sorting Algorithms:
  - âœ… Bubble Sort
  - âœ… Insertion Sort
  - âœ… Merge Sort
  - âœ… Quick Sort
  - âœ… Heap Sort
-  Bar visualization of array elements
-  Shuffle functionality to randomize the array
- Dropdown menu to select and visualize any algorithm
- Uses Java threads to animate sorting without freezing the UI
